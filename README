This is my second attempt at a Tic-Tac-Toe game, in Java this time.

The computer player's AI uses the minimax algorithm.

The view can also be easily switched out between a console version and a Swing GUI version (just exchange ConsoleView
and SwingView in src/TicTacToe.java).

To play the game, run

ant

in the root directory to build the Java binaries and run the test suite; then

cd out && java TicTacToe
